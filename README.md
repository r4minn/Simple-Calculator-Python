# Simple-Calculator-Python
Hello. This is my first ever script made in python. I hope that you like it and appreciate it. REMINDER: I have about 2 days experience working in python so don't blame me if it doesn't work correctly

How to use:
git clone https://github.com/r4minn/Simple-Calculator-Python

cd Simple-Calculator-Python

python calculator.py (if u use the Romanian version type: python calculator_ro.py)

Enjoy
